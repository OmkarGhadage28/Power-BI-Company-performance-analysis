# Introduction to the Project:
This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of company performance metrics. We gathered data across departments like IT, Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR, and Operations. Our key focus is on understanding the financial health of the company, employee productivity, and customer satisfaction, and how these factors influence the companyâ€™s market position.

The purpose of this project is to uncover insights that can help our organization make strategic decisions. This includes identifying areas where costs can be reduced, departments with higher turnover, and revenue opportunities.

This dashboard was designed to support decision-making at the executive level. It focuses on trend analysis, identifying bottlenecks, and uncovering areas where operational efficiency can be improved.

# Goals and Objectives
## Our key objectives for this project were:

To understand the financial performance of each department (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit margins).
To analyze employee productivity and turnover rates, which affect operational efficiency.
To assess customer satisfaction and retention, key drivers for future growth.
To identify any departments that are underperforming or exceeding expectations.
By answering these questions, we can suggest strategies to improve overall performance and profitability.

## Dashboard Structure Overview
The dashboard is structured into several key sections: Financial Performance, Employee Productivity, and Customer Satisfaction. We have also included filters so that users can explore data by department and year.

## Insight:
1. You can see that revenue generally increased over time, with a notable spike in 2022. However, in Q4 2023, profits slightly dipped, signaling potential inefficiencies or increased costs.

2. We see that Finance and Operations consistently have higher profit margins, while Sales, despite generating high revenue, struggles with profitability due to higher expenses.

3. We notice that departments like IT and Finance have higher productivity scores with moderate revenue per employee, while Sales has lower productivity but generates more revenue per employee due to large client deals.

4. Marketing has seen a dip in customer satisfaction in 2022, while Operations has consistently maintained high satisfaction scores.

5. We observe that when turnover spiked in Q3 2021, revenue growth slowed down, suggesting that employee retention directly impacts financial performance.
